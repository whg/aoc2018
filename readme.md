## Advent of Code 2018

### Going for 25 languages in 25 days!

| Day | Language | Run | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **bash** | `$ ./day1.sh input/day1.txt` | Probably not a good idea to use a filesytem as a dictionary |
| 2 | **Python** | `$ python day2.py input/day2.txt` | Use it everyday, I love it |
| 3 | **JavaScript** | `$ node day3.py` | I quite like it |
| 4 | **Perl** | `$ ./day4.pl input/day4.txt` | Man, this language is flexible! |
| 5 | **Scala** | `$ ./day5.scala` | This is a sweet language! |
| 6 | **D** | `$ dmd day6.d && ./day6` | I like it! |
| 7 | **Io** | `$ io day7.io` | Very interesting |
| 8 | **C#** | `$ csc day8.cs && mono day8.exe` | Don't like this language... |
| 9 | **C++** | `$ g++ -o day9 day9.cpp && ./day9` | Use it all the time... |
| 10 | **Clojure** | `$ cd day10; lein run` | Writing this makes me squint |
| 11 | **Pascal** | `$ fpc day11.pas && ./day11` | No wonder people are put of programming at school |
| 12 | **Haskell** | `$ ghc -dynamic day12.hs && ./day12` | It's pretty cool |
| 13 | **Java** | `$ javac day13.java && java Day13` | Aaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhhhhh! |

## Notes
### Day 1
Probably best not to try this one at home, part 2 takes ages (hours) to return!
